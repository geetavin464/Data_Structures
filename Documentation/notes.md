* __Observations__
  * `while` loop is high maintanence
  * You have to initialize & index the index variable
  * `for` loop is low maintenance
  * It initializes, checks, increments all by itself

* __Nested Loops__
  * Outer loop is stationed while the inner loop makes a traversal
  * Outer loop increments and stations, while the inner loop makes another traversal
