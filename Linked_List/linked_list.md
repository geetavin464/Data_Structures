* Basic Operations
  * A linked list is structure composed of list of nodes. 
  * A node contains data and reference to the next
  * Linked list is not a continuous block of memory
  * Hence does not support random access
  * Search & Remove require full scan linear time. O(n)
  * Insertion & Removal (at head) is constant time
  * A reference to the head is enough to identify the entire list
  * Empty lists are when the head is nill

* Common Programming Problems requie
  * Identifying boundary cases
  * Clever Traversal Techniques
  * Judicious use of temporary variables
